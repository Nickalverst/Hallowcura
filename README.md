# Hallowcura

The development of a digital game which applied the concepts taught during classes was required for the conclusion of
the Programming Techniques course. To accomplish this, Hallowcura - a game in which the player must battle their way 
through two short levels whilst avoiding obstacles - was developed. The program was constructed according to the requirements
presented via the text document and generic Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagram provided by the professor. After 
studying the requirements, the software development cycle began, contemplating the gradual completion of the class diagram,
coding (using the C++ programming language) and testing of recently added features. The process involved both basic and advanced
concepts related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), such as polymorphism and templates, respectively.
